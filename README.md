# FaceEngine

Project main purpose is to simplify work with __face recognition problem__ 
computation core trio - _detector_, _embedder(encoder)_, and _predictor_. FaceEngine 
combines all of them in one interface model to simplify usage and furthermore 
extends facilities.

## Usage

#### Getting it
To download FaceEngine, either pull this github repo or simply use Pypi via pip:

    $ pip3 install face-engine
FaceEngine is supported only on Python 3.6 and above.
    
To fetch project default models use: 

    $ fetch_models
    
Default models requires you to install [dlib](http://dlib.net/compile.html) :heavy_exclamation_mark:

#### Using it:
FaceEngine is working out of the box, with pre-defined default models:

```python
>>> from face_engine import FaceEngine
>>> engine = FaceEngine()
```
to change models use appropriate setter methods, for example to use 
more robust dlib face detector model `'mmod'` (see [`face_engine/models/mmod_detector.py`](https://github.com/guesswh0/face_engine/blob/master/face_engine/models/mmod_detector.py)
) use:

```python
>>> engine.detector = 'mmod'
```
 
 
#### Lets do some __face recognition__:

1. prepare some dataset with image urls/paths and class_names
 
```python
>>> images = ['person1.jpg', 'person2.jpg', 'person3.jpg']
>>> class_names = ['person1', 'person2', 'person3']
```

2. fit predictor model with prepared data

```python
>>> engine.fit(images, class_names)
```

3. and finally make predictions on test images

```python
>>> from skimage import io
>>> image = io.imread('test_image.jpg.')
>>> scores, class_names = engine.predict(image)
```

### Custom models
Pre-defined default models are used to show how to work with FaceEngine. 
These models are working pretty well, but if you want to, you can work with your 
own _custom pre-trained models_. 
All you need to do is to implement model interface 
`Detector`, `Embedder` or `Predictor` (see [models](https://github.com/guesswh0/face_engine/blob/master/face_engine/models/__init__.py) 
package), and import it with either directly importing your model or adding it 
to `PYTHONPATH` environment variable or using appropriate convenient function 
from `face_engine.tools`. This will register your model class object itself 
in `models` dictionary, from where it become visible.
 
FaceEngine models used to register all inheriting imported subclasses 
(subclass registration [#PEP487](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0487/)).  

To init with your own pre-trained detector use:
```python
>>> from my_custom_models import my_custom_detector
>>> engine = FaceEngine(detector='custom_detector')
```

To switch to your own model use corresponding setter method:

```python
>>> from my_custom_models import my_custom_detector
>>> engine.detector = 'custom_detector'
```
 
How to train your own custom model is out of this user guide scope =).

## Notice
There is also a few methods, but it is better if you will try to figure them 
out by yourself.

I didn't wrote full documentation or tutorial yet (hope doing so sooner or later), 
in the meantime for more detailed info on models or engine itself see docstrings.
