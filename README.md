# Face Engine - The simplest face recognition!

Project main purpose is to simplify work with __face recognition problem__ 
computation core trio - *detector*, *embedder*, and *predictor*. FaceEngine 
combines all of them in one interface model to simplify usage and furthermore 
extends facilities and adds some features.

## Usage

#### Getting it
To download face engine, either pull this github repo or simply use Pypi via pip:

    $ pip install face-engine
    
To fetch project default models use: 

    $ fetch_models

#### Using it:
FaceEngine is working out of the box, with pre-defined default models:

```python
from face_engine import FaceEngine
engine = FaceEngine()
```
to change default model use appropriate setter method, for example to use 
more robust face detector model `'mmod'` 
(see `face_engine/models/mmod_detector.py`) use:

```python
engine.detector = 'mmod'
```
 
 
#### Lets do some __face recognition__:

1. prepare some dataset with image urls/paths and class_names
 
    ```python
    images = ['person1.jpg', 'person2.jpg', 'person3.jpg']
    class_names = ['person1', 'person2', 'person3']
    ```

2. fit predictor model with prepared data

    ```python
    engine.fit(images, class_names)
    ```

3. and finally make predictions on test images

    ```python
    from skimage import io
    image = io.imread('test_image.jpg.')
    score, class_name = engine.predict(image)
    ```

Pre-defined default models is used to show how to work with `FaceEngine`. 
This models are working very good, but if you are ~~computer-vision~~ 
developer you probably could think of working  with your own 
pre-trained models!? With `FaceEngine` you can easily plug your
model in and use it. All you need to do is to implement model interface 
`Detector`, `Embedder` or `Predictor` (see `models` package rules), `register` 
model (import) and `create` instance of it with `use_plugin` method.

How to train your own model is out of this user guide scope =), try ask to 
[@davidsandberg](https://github.com/davidsandberg) ;) 

```python
from face_engine.models import Detector
engine.use_plugin(Detector, name='mmod', filepath='face_engine/models/mmod_detector.py')
```
this will import all your *dependencies* and *register* your model class 
object itself in `models` dictionary and then will *create* instance of it.   

All pre-defined default models is also considered as plugin models :heavy_exclamation_mark:


## Notice
There is also a few methods, but it is better if you will try figure them 
out by yourself.

I didn't wrote full documentation or tutorial yet (hope doing so sooner or later), 
that's why more detailed info on models or engine itself see docstrings.

Questions? Issues? feel free to [ask](https://github.com/guesswh0/face_engine/issues/new).
Thank you for choosing my project.
